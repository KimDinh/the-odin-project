        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A strong Vietnamese iced coffee recipe with sweetened condensed milk.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tablespoons (30 ml) Sweetened Condensed Milk</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons coarse ground Coffee
                (use a roast suitable for espresso, the grind the same as for a french press)</li>
            <li>Hot Water (almost to a boil)</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the sweetened condensed milk into an 8-10 oz glass.</li>
            <li>Remove the top screen from the coffee filter.
                Put the ground coffee in the filter, screw screen back on, compacting the grounds.</li>
            <li>Place filter on the glass with the sweetened condensed milk.
                Pour just enough hot water to cover the grounds and let sit for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Loosen the filter screen screw at least 2 full rotations.
                Pour hot water to top of filter, cover and let sit until water has gone all the way through filter
                (It should take about 5 minutes at a rate of 3-4 drips/sec. If it is faster, coffee's grind is too coarse. If slower, coffee's grind is too fine.)</li>
            <li>When water has passed though filter, remove filter from glass.
                Stir coffee and sweetened condensed milk together.</li>
            <li>Stirring coffee and sweetened condensed milk together</li>
            <li>Add ice and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
