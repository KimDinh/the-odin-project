        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thit kho tau (caramelized pork belly) is a very popular dish in Vietnamese households for everyday eating,
            but it's also traditionally served during Tet, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. Serve with rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds pork belly, trimmed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>5 shallots, sliced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>13 fluid ounces coconut water</li>
            <li>6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice pork belly into 1-inch pieces layered with skin, fat, and meat.</li>
            <li>Heat sugar in a large wok or pot over medium heat until it melts and caramelizes into a light brown syrup, about 5 minutes.
                Add pork and increase the heat to high. Cook and stir to render some of the pork fat, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir shallots and garlic into the wok. Add fish sauce and black pepper; stir until pork is evenly coated.
                Pour in coconut water and bring to a boil. Add hard-boiled eggs and reduce the heat to low.
                Cover and simmer, checking occasionally and adding a little water if the liquid evaporates too much, until pork is tender, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and let stand for about 10 minutes. Skim fat from the surface of the dish.</li>
        </ol>
