            Set carrot mixture aside in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.<br>
            Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture.<br>
            Place 1 egg atop each serving.<br>
            Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste.</li>
